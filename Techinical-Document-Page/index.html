                Numpy is a general-purpose array-processing package. It provides a high-performance multidimensional array object, 
                and tools for working with these arrays. It is the fundamental package for scientific computing with Python.

                Benefits of Numpy against python lists:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    NumPy operations are implemented in C and are much faster than Python lists for numerical computations. 
                    This is because NumPy arrays are densely packed arrays of homogeneous type whereas Python lists can contain elements of different types, requiring additional type checking and overhead.
                </li>
                <li>
                    NumPy arrays are more memory efficient than Python lists. Python lists are more flexible, but this flexibility comes at a cost of higher memory usage per element. 
                    NumPy arrays, on the other hand, are more compact in memory because they are homogeneous and allow for better memory management.
                </li>
                <li>
                    NumPy provides a wide range of mathematical 
                    functions and operators that are not available in the standard Python lists. These functions make it easy to perform complex operations and computations on arrays with just a single line of code.

                Arrays in Numpy can be created by multiple ways, with various number of Ranks, defining the size of the Array. 
                Arrays can also be created with the use of various data types such as lists, tuples, etc. The type of the resultant array is deduced from the type of the elements in the sequences.
            </p>

                In a numpy array, indexing or accessing the array index can be done in multiple ways. 
                To print a range of an array, slicing is done. Slicing of an array is defining a range in a new array which 
                is used to print a range of elements from the original array. Since, sliced array holds a range of elements of the original 
                array, modifying content with the help of sliced array modifies the original array content.

                Index_arr = arr[[1, 1, 0, 3], [3, 2, 1, 0]]<br>
                print(Index_arr[0,0])//access item at position [0][0]

                In numpy, arrays allow a wide range of operations which can be performed on a particular array or a combination of Arrays. 
                These operation include some basic Mathematical operation as well as Unary and Binary operations.

                Every Numpy array is a table of elements (usually numbers), all of the same type, indexed by a 
                tuple of positive integers. Every ndarray has an associated data type (dtype) object. This data type object (dtype) 
                provides information about the layout of the array. The values of an ndarray are stored in a 
                buffer which can be thought of as a contiguous block of memory bytes which can be interpreted by the dtype object. 
                Numpy provides a large set of numeric datatypes that can be used to construct arrays. At the time of Array creation, 
                Numpy tries to guess a datatype, but functions that construct arrays usually also include an optional argument to explicitly specify the datatype.
            </p>
            <p>
                In Numpy, datatypes of Arrays need not to be defined unless a specific datatype is required. 
                Numpy tries to guess the datatype for Arrays which are not predefined in the constructor function.

                x = np.array([1, 2])<br>

                x = np.array([1.0, 2.0]) <br>
                print(x.dtype) //output float64 <br>
                x = np.array([1, 2], dtype = np.int64) <br>

            <p>
                In Numpy arrays, basic mathematical operations are performed element-wise on the array. 
                These operations are applied both as operator overloads and as functions. 
                Many useful functions are provided in Numpy for performing computations on Arrays such as sum: for addition of Array elements, 
                T: for Transpose of elements, etc.

                arr2 = np.array([[3, 6], [2, 8]], dtype = np.float64) <br>
                print(np.add(arr1, arr2)) //output arraysum <br>
                print(np.sum(arr1)) //output sum of array1 <br>
                Sqrt = np.sqrt(arr1) //output square root of array1
